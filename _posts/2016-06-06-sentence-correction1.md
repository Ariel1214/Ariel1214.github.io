## Chapter1 The SC Process 
**GMAT 语法的做题步骤**   

1. **Take a first glance**   
先浏览一遍题目：不要读题，只是先浏览下整个题干和选项，划线部分多长？划线部分的开头是怎样的？
2. **Read the sentence for the meaning**    
时刻铭记语法与语意，大多数人容易忽略句子想要表达什么。有些句子可能语法是正确的，但语意不符合逻辑或模糊
3. **Find a starting point**   
找开始不一定是划线部分的开始，而是做题可以排除的点，也就是可以着手的开始点。Initially, you're likely to have one of two starting points:    
 - You spot an error (or suspected error) in the original sentence.
 - You notice splits, or differences, in the answers.        
4. **Eliminate all incorrect answers**   
排除你所有确定的错误答案——如果还剩下多于1个答案，就找新的开始点——直至选出正确答案。时刻铭记 "Best Does Not Mean Ideal"，也就是要选 5 个选项里的最优项，很可能最优的那个选项不是完美的

**SC Timing 做题时间**    
为了给字数篇幅较大的阅读（RC）和逻辑（CR）腾出时间，SC 平均每道题用 1 分 20 秒，那么如何做到呢？有 3 点可以帮到你      

 - 大多数错误答案都有至少一个错误，这样你就很容易排除了，因为嘛，那么多错误点，你总会找到一个的   
 - 同样的一个错误经常出现在两个或更多个选项里，也就是说，你找一个错误点了，很可能可以排除2个或以上的选项     
 - The SC process described earlier capitalizes on the first two points above to get you through the problem as efficiently as possible.

**其他**    
在复习时，排除错误项时需要做笔记   
>Wrong: The value of the stock ROSE by a 10% INCREASE.    
>Right: The value of the stock INCREASED by 10%.     

在排除 wrong answer 时，要写上 redundant, rose or increase, not both。当然了，我们用中文最顺手，直接写 rose 和 increase 重复。

## Chapter 2  Grammar & Meaning    
#### 语法
如 Does everyone have their book? 这在日常生活中很常见，然而它的语法是错误的，正确说法应该是 Does everyone have his or her book?  
比较常用的语法知识点有 sentence structure, modifiers, parallelism, comparisons, pronouns, verbs, and idioms. 这些在以后都会分章节来总结的。

#### 语法之 5 个要知道的语法术语
**1. Clause 句子**   
A clause is a set of words that contains a subject and a working verb，即句子一定要有主语和谓语。如 She applied for the job. 主语是she，谓语是applied。     
句子有分为独立句子和非独立句子，虽然他们都有主语和谓语，但是非独立句子不能单独存在。要注意，非独立句子一定要有主语和谓语，除非在某些特定情况下能省略主语。    
 
**2. Modifier 修饰语**   
A modifier provides additional information in a sentence, beyond the core subject and verb.
修饰语也可能很复杂，如 The large dog, which has black fur, is a Labrador. “which has black fur” 就是修饰 dog 的 nonessential modifier。什么是 nonessential modifier 呢？就是去掉这个修饰语后，句子的意思很清楚、没有歧义：The large dog is a Labrador.    

还有一种修饰语是essential modifier，如The job that she started last week is much harder than her previous job. 之说以说that she started last week是essential modifier，是因为去掉这个修饰后，句子就有歧义了。

**3. Sentence Core 句子核心**     
The core of a sentence consists of any independent clauses along with some essential modifiers. 

**4. Conjunction 连词**    
Conjunctions are words that help to stick parts of sentences together.     
Coordinating conjunctions 并列连词（能够连接两个独立的句子）：for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. 如 “and” 连接词 He worked hard, and a raise was his reward.  
subordinating conjunctions 从属连词：although，because, while, though, unless, before, after, and if. 如，Although she didn't have much work experience, she was offered the job.

**5. Marker 标记**    
A marker is a flag or clue that a certain kind of issue is being tested. Maker 并不是 an official grammar term, 但它很重要，比如看到 unlike 这个 marker 时，你会马上想到这要考查比较。

#### 语意    
要能够清楚地表达作者的意图。GMAT 语法 prefer to concision，如果用 6 个字能够表达清楚题意，GMAT 将不愿意用 7 个字的说法，当然 concision 只是 preference 而不是 rule，当只剩下两个选项时才建议从简洁原则出发进行排除，主要关注语法和语意。Furthermore, Official Guide (OG) explanations often label a sentence wordy or awkward without additional explanation; typically, these sentences have a meaning problem or an idiom error.    

The GMAT tends to make use of “small” errors in meaning that can be easy to overlook. Most instances of meaning errors fall into one of three major categories:  
1. Choose your word       
2. Place your words      
3. Match your words

**Error 1——Choose your words**  
考点 1：Did the author pick the right words out of the dictionary? 是否选对单词？   
考点 2：If a word has more than one meaning, is the author using that word correctly, to indicate the right meaning? 多义词    
考点 3：GMAT tries to pull a trick on you by switching a particular word and its cousin. 形近的单词   

形近词举例       

- Economic (经济的, Economic considerations=monetary considerations) vs. economical (节约的, thrifty, efficient)       
- aggravate (worsen—vt.加重、恶化、使恼火) vs. aggravating (irritating—adj.使恶化的,加重的,恼人的)
- known as (named—被称为,公认为) vs. known to be (acknowledged as)
- loss of (no longer in possession of—不再占有) vs. loss in (decline in value—价值减少)
- mandate (command—vt. 托管, 批准; n. 任期) vs. have a mandate (have authority from voters)
- native of (person from) vs. native to (species that originated in)
- range of (variety of) vs. ranging (varying)
- rate of (speed or frequency of) vs. rates for (prices for)
- rise (general increase) vs. raise (a bet or a salary increase in American English)
- try to do (seek to accomplish) vs. try doing (experiment with)

助动词 helping verb 的考查   
助动词：may, will, must, and should。GMAT有时也从助动词的角度考查语意。在GMAT考试中，must指Absolutely Necessary，should指Morally Obliged.    
切记，should在GMAT考试中的是Morally Obliged，比如在日常用语中，, you can say The train should arrive now to mean that the train is likely to arrive now, but the GMAT doesn't agree with this usage.

此外，还有一种考法  
>Actual: If Chris and Jad met, they DISCUSSED mathematics.  
Hypothetical: If Chris and Jad met, they WOULD DISCUSS mathematics.  

第一个句子，表示如果C and J见面，则后面的一定发生；第二句表示，见面后，他们可能讨论数学。

**Error 2——Place your words**  
单词的位置会改变句子的意思。  
在考试中，if a word changes its position in the answer choices, consider whether the change has an impact on the meaning of the sentence. Look out especially for short words (such as only and all) that quantify nouns or otherwise restrict meaning.

此外，还要关注overall word order  
The council granted the right to make legal petitions TO CITY OFFICIALS.(AWKWARD)   
歧义：  
The council granted the right to make legal petitions TO CITY OFFICIALS（grant sth to sb）市政将合法诉求的权利授权给CO。或The council granted/ the right ( to make legal petitions TO CITY OFFICIALS)市政将向CO进行合法诉求的权利授权了。下面两个句子，将overall word换了之后，就解决的歧义。  
The council granted CITY OFFICIALS the right to make legal petitions. 歧义中的第一个解释  
The right to make legal petitions TO CITY OFFICIALS was granted by the council. 歧义中的第二个解释

**Error 3——Match your words**  
举例来讲，Unlike Alaska, where the winter is quite cold, the temperature in Florida rarely goes below freezing. 虽然我们都知道，这个句子是说Alaska和Florida冬天的问题，但句子将Alaska与Florida的temperature比较了，所以不匹配。  

同时，Avoid redundancy  
Redundancy goes beyond mere concision—redundancy confuses the meaning, causing the reader to ask: “Did I read that right?” No right answer on the GMAT will contain redundant words.

## Chapter 3  Sentence Structure
#### Subject and Verb Must Both Exist 必须有主语和谓语
Every sentence must have a subject and a verb.一个完整的句子必须包括主语和谓语（动词）。On the GMAT, the correct answer must be a complete sentence, or independent clause.

此外，还有一些非独立的句子，比如  
Wrong: BECAUSE the dog was never mine.   
Wrong: WHICH will be approved tomorrow  

Because and which are connecting words. They add extra information to a sentence, but they are not sentences by themselves. Because和which都是连接词，它们能够增加一个句子的信息，但是自己不能是一个句子。

#### Subject and Verb Must Agree in Number
复数主语对复数谓语——A singular subject requires a singular verb form: The dog runs out of the house.   
单数主语对单数谓语——A plural subject requires a plural verb form: The dogs run out of the house.

当然了，GMAT也不会考得这么简单，GMAT在考试时，经常将主语隐藏起来，以致于考生分不清哪个是主语。如果你不知道主语的单复情况，那么动词的单复形式就无法确定了。

如，The discovery of new medicines was vital to the company's growth. 在本句中，主语是the discovery，那么谓语则为单数形式was   
再如，Lin and Guy drive to work. 在本句中，Lin and Guy是compound subject（复合主语，复合主语必须用and连接），谓语是复数形式，所以是drive。   
而"Lin, as well as Guy, drives to work every day. " 中as well as Guy是主语Lin的修饰部分。
 
#### Eliminate the Middlemen and Skip the Warmup忽略插入语和“热身”语
为了迷惑考生，GMAT考试经常insert words between the subject and the verb，也就是插入语（middlemen），如果在寻找主语时，你能够忽略插入语，那么主谓一致对你就很容易了。此外，GMAT考试中，主语前经常有很多单词，这些单词就是warmup，在找主语时，考生也应该学会忽略warmup

在GMAT考试中，一共有三种情况的middlemen和warmup。  
**1. Prepositional Phrases 介词短语**  
A prepositional phrase is a group of words headed by a preposition，介词短语如下所示：   
of mice，  for milk，  by 1800，  in Zambia，  with her，  at that level，  to the store，  on their orders，  from the office   
介词短语中的名词不可能是主语。   
如，Near Galway, the houses on the road to Spiddle is/are gorgeous. 我们对该句进行分析，near Galway、on the road都修饰 the house，所以删掉，主语为the houses，那么谓语就是are了。Near Galway, the HOUSES on the road to Spiddle ARE gorgeous.

**2. Dependent Clauses 非独立句子**   
Dependent clauses, which begin with connecting words such as who or because, cannot stand alone as sentences.  
下面我们来看下独立句子与非独立句子的例子    
非独立句子: Which begin with connecting words such as who or because. which前面没主语，which引导depend clause   
独立句子: Dependent clauses cannot stand alone as. 主语Dependent clauses，谓语cannot stand.  
对于独立句子来说，句子中的非独立句子移除后，剩下的句子仍然是一个完整的句子，现在我们看下面这句话：Because she studied hard, she earned a good score on the test.该句可以分解成以下非独立句子和独立句子：  
Dependent: because she studied hard.  
Independent: She earned a good score on the test.

**3. Other Modifiers**  
Other words can also function as modifiers, which add extra information to the sentence. 具体的将在chapter 4讲到。

**Use Structure to Decide**  
在寻找主语时，去掉warmup与middlemen，然后利用主谓一致，确定谓语的单复数。

如，The tidal forces to which an object falling into a black hole is/are subjected is/are sufficient to tear the object apart.  
这个句子主句中有主语和谓语，从句中也存在主语和谓语，确定的顺序是：忽略从句，先找主句中的主谓；确定主句主谓后，忽略主句再找从句的主谓。  

step 1： 忽略从句to which an object falling into a black hole is/are subjected，剩下“The tidal forces is/are sufficient to tear the object apart.”主语“the tidal forces”，所以谓语为are，即The tidal forces are sufficient to tear the object apart.   
step 2：忽略主句，只看从句。to which an object falling into a black hole is/are subjected.   
step 3：去掉warmup与修饰部分，剩下 an object is/are subjected.   
step 4：确定谓语为is，正确句子即为The tidal forces to which an object falling into a black hole is subjected are sufficient to tear the object apart.

**Building Complex Sentences**  
在GMAT考试中，为增加难度，出题者经常使用长难句，如下面的句子：  
Despite some initial concerns, the teacher is confident that her students mastered the lesson.   
这个句子的核心部分是 the teacher is confident，that在working verb之后，it acts as a “re-set” button in the sentence: a new subject–verb–object structure will follow，即that引导了一个从句，而从句里有它自己的主谓宾，即her students mastered the lesson.   
在实际生活中，that经常被省略，然而在GMAT考试中是错误的，因为省略that可能使句子ambiguous.

**Two Independent Clauses**  

1. conjunctions连词  
两个独立的句子，能用逗号和一个连接在一起，来组成一个并列句，如下面的句子  
Lin drove to work, and Guy rode his bike.  
并列句有两个或两个以上的主谓结构。这些主谓结构之间的关系是并列的、对等的。  
常见的连接词有7个，可以用FANBOYS来记忆 **For，And，Nor，But，Or，Yet，So**。  
然而，不能只用逗号连接两个独立的句子，否则会造成run-on sentence
2. Semicolon 分号  
同时，还可以用semicolon分号连接两个独立的句子，如Earl walked to school; he later ate his lunch.  此外，分号后面经常会有转折词，如however, therefore和in addition. 这种情况下，分号+转折词的作用与分号自己的作用是一样的，也就是说这些转折词并不是连词，必须用分号连接带转折词的句子，而不能用逗号，如：  
Wrong: Andrew and Lisa are inseparable, THEREFORE, we never see them apart.  
Right: Andrew and Lisa are inseparable; THEREFORE, we never see them apart.  
最后，是一种很少见的正确用法：to separate items that themselves contain commas，如  
Wrong: I listen to Earth, Wind & Fire, Wow, Owls, and Blood, Sweat & Tears.  
Right: I listen to Earth, Wind & Fire; Wow, Owls; and Blood, Sweat & Tears.

## Chapter 4  Modifiers
A modifier（修饰语）describes or provides extra information about something else in the sentence.  
#### Adjectives and Adverbs 形容词和副词
Adjectives and adverbs are one-word modifiers. 形容词只修饰名词和代词，然而an adverb modifies almost anything but a noun or a pronoun. 

举个例子：The smart STUDENT WORKS quickly. smart修饰名词student，quickly修饰动词work.

The GMAT will sometimes offer answers that use an adjective where an adverb is grammatically required and vice versa.

如下面3句话：  
>Amy is a good PERSON. good是形容词，修饰名词person。  
>Amy is well. well是形容词，修饰名词Amy。  
>Amy WRITES well. well是副词，修饰动词write。  

在GMAT考试中，出题者会出两个语法都对的句子，然而其中只有一个对。

Max's grandmother is his supposed Irish ancestor.（supposed修饰ancestor，语意是，Max的grandmother可能是他的ancestor，然而Logically, Max's grandmother has to be his ancestor）  
Max's grandmother is his supposedly Irish ancestor. （supposedly修饰Iirsh，implying that Max's grandmother is not actually Irish）。所以，第二句正确。

GMAT考试中常用的形容词有corresponding, frequent, independent, rare, recent, seeming, separate, significant, supposed, and usual.  
如果在考试中，在选择用副词还是形容词时犹豫的话，想下要修饰什么？如果修饰名词和代词，则选择形容词。

#### Noun Modifiers 名词修饰语
通常都是形容词修饰名词，同时Other types of noun modifiers扮演形容词的作用，即Preposition（介词）、Past Participle（过去分词）、Present Participle without Commas（没有逗号的现在分词）。

介词：Sue placed the CAT on the couch. （Where is the cat? ——on the couch）  
过去分词：The CAT owned by Sue is playful. （Whose cat is it? ——the one owned by Sue)  
没有逗号的现在分词：The CAT sleeping on the rug belongs to Sue.（Which cat？——the one sleeping on the rug）

什么时候用Noun Modifiers？ When you can ask a "who, what, which, or where" question about a noun, and the answer points to the modifier, you have a noun modifier.

**1. 限定性修饰与非限定性修饰**

看下面两个句子，有什么不同？  
The cat, which lives next door, is very noisy.  
The cat that lives next door is very noisy.

第一个句子，谈话的人已经知道是哪只猫了，which lives next door只是提供extra information；第二个句子，谈话的人不知道是哪只猫，而that lives next door这个修饰语would be used to distinguish between multiple cats when you don't already know which cat the speaker wants to discuss. If three cats are playing in front of you, the speaker would specify the cat that lives next door, not the other two cats.

非限定性修饰：“，+which从句”，当你把修饰语从句子中移除时，句子的主要意思仍然是完整的，即you still retain the full meaning of the main part of the sentence

限定性修饰：“that从句”，当你把限定性修饰语从句子中移除时，句子的意思就不禁推敲了。

**2. Position of Noun Modifiers 名词修饰语的位置**  
要把noun modifiers放到正确的位置，否则the sentence may have an illogical or ambiguous meaning,即句子会出现语意问题   
Remember this rule: Place a NOUN and its MODIFIER as close together as possible—the closer, the better!

在大多数情况下，名词和它的修饰语应该紧挨着，然而有些情况，名词和它的修饰语之间会有一些其他的修饰语，如The box of nails, which is nearly full, belongs to Jean.  
名词box有两个修饰语：of nails和which is nearly full，因为有两个修饰语，必定有一个会不挨着名词。然而要哪个修饰语紧挨着名词呢？答案是，必要性修饰词（essential adjectives）。  
看下面两个句子，哪个更好些？  
>Jim biked along an old dirt road to get to his house, which cut through the woods.  
>To get to his house, Jim biked along an old dirt road, which cut through the woods.  

什么cut through the woods? The road. Modifiers should be as close as possible to the nouns they modify.所以第二句更好，which紧挨着要修饰的名词road。

**3. Possessive Nouns Are Not Nouns! 所有格名词不是名词**  
如 Happy about his raise, Bill's celebration included taking his friends out to dinner. Happy修饰的是Bill而不是Bill's celebration。从句子结构上看，句子想表达的意思是“Bill's celebration is happy about his raise.”语意illogically。
改为：Happy about his raise, Bill celebrated by taking his friends to dinner.

**4. Noun Modifier Markers: Relative Pronouns名词修饰语的标记：关系代词**  
Noun modifiers（关系代词）are often introduced by relative pronouns such as the following: `Which`、`That`、`Who`、`Whose`、`Whom`、`Where`、`When`.

第一，上面的修饰词，除了that以外经常是noun modifiers的marker. 如果that前面是名词，that就是名词的noun modifier，如果that前面是动词，that就引导了一个更加复杂的句型：subject–verb–THAT–subject–verb–object.

第二，who和whom必须修饰人，而其他的代词不能修饰人，而whose可以除人以外的物，如The town whose water supply was contaminated is near the steel factory.

第三，Which 或 whom 有时在介词的后面，如： the canal through which water flows; the senator（参议员）for whom we worked.

第四，where修饰名词性的地方，如area, site, country, or city；然而where不能修饰“不明确的、隐喻的”地方，如condition, situation, case, circumstances, or arrangement.   
Wrong: We had an arrangement WHERE he cooked and I cleaned.   
Right: We had an arrangement IN WHICH he cooked and I cleaned.

第五，when 能够修饰 a noun event or time, such as period, age, 1987, or decade.在这种情况下，when = in which.

**5. 介词和分词做名词修饰语**  
介词短语和分词可以修饰副词，那么，要如何区分到底是修饰的名词还是修饰的是副词呢？  
一般来说，以介词短语为例，如果介词短语是跟在名词后面，那么它就是的就是这个名词，如The executive DIRECTOR of the company resigned three days ago. of the company修饰的是名词director。  

你能找到下面这个句子里的名词修饰语吗？  
Researchers discovered that the most common risk factor resulting in cholera epidemics is the lack of a clean water supply.  
step 1 找句子的主干（即主谓宾），researchers +discovered + that 从句；       
step 2 找从句中的主干，common risk factor + is + the lack；        
step 3 从句中的主语the most common risk factor跟随现在分词resulting in……，说明resulting是名词risk factor的修饰语，同时形容词common也是risk factor的修饰语，副词most修容形容词common；        
step 4 从句中的宾语the lack后面跟随的介词短语of a clean water supply修饰名词the lack。   
所以，本句的名词修饰语为Researchers discovered that the most common RISK FACTOR resulting in cholera epidemics is the LACK of a clean water supply.

**6. 分词**  
分词又分为现在分词（Present Participle）和过去分词（Past Participle）两种      

**现在分词**  
现在分词一般以-ing结尾，现在分词可以是动词，也可以是名词，还可以是各种形式的修饰语。  
A. She is playing soccer.      is playing 是动词形式  
B. Playing soccer is fun.      playing = subject (noun), 是名词形式  
C. The girl playing soccer is my sister.   noun modifier，playing 是修饰语，修饰名词 the girl  
D.She stayed all day, playing soccer until she was the only one left on the field.  Playing soccer … field = adverbial modifier（即我们常说的状语），playing 以及后面的一整句话都是状语，形容动词 stayed，同时 all day 也形容 stayed。  

那么要如何区分现在分词的作用呢？  
第一：Any –ing word functioning as part of the verb form will have another verb immediately before it, as in the is playing example.如果现在分词做动词时，前面肯定有另外一个动词，如例子A中的is playing  
第二：Any –ing words that are not verbs and not separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma will either be a noun, as in Playing soccer is fun, or modify another noun, as in The girl playing soccer is my sister. 如果现在分词在句子中不是动词的作用且现在分词和句子中的其他成分用逗号隔开的话，那么这个动词不是做名词（如例子B）就是做名词的修饰语（如例子C）。  
第三：any “comma–ing” structures are adverbial modifiers，任何的“，+ing”都是状语。  

**过去分词**  
过去分词一般都以-ed结尾。在GMAT考试中考查过去分词的频率没有现在分词高。在常用规则中，过去分词语现在分词的不同是：首先过去分词自己单独可以作为名词，其次过去分词不能做名词。  

A. She played the lottery yesterday.                 played = verb play  做动词，是过去时  
B. She accidentally bought an expired lottery ticket.    expired（失效的）= noun modifier，形容名词lottery ticket  
C. Exhausted from her job, she bought a lottery ticket with hopes of winning big.   exhausted… job = adverbial modifier 状语  
关于例子C，exhausted……修饰哪部分。我们可以认为exhausted修饰名词she，谁exhausted了？She was，能够合理解释，在本句中也可以说的过去。但是，在GMAT语法中，我们还要看句子余下的部分，因为要是修饰主语话，我们可以按照语法的原则写出下面这个句子，Exhausted from her job, she has red hair. 然而这句话的语意就不符合逻辑了，累了就有红头发了？所以exhausted应该修饰主从句，这样就不会写出不合逻辑的句子了，例子C可以理解成，Because she was exhausted, she bought a lottery ticket with hopes of winning big.  

**7. Adverbial Modifiers 状语**  

**状语修饰什么？**  
状语可以修饰动词（verbs）和副词（adverbs），也可以修饰形容词、介词短语、副词，就是除了不能修饰名词以外，可以修饰任何词性的词。  

首先，副词做状语，如rapidly，The engineer rapidly IDENTIFIED the problem. 这句话的意思是How did the engineer identify the problem? (rapidly)  

其次，介词短语做状语，如on Mondays，The TEAMATTENDS staff meetings on Mondays. When does the team attend staff meetings? (on Mondays)  

再次，“，+ing”做状语，如The ENGINEER FIXED THEPROBLEM, earning himself a promotion. What happened when the engineer fixed the problem? (he earned himself a promotion)  

最后，“过去分词+，”做状语，如Exhilarated by the successful product launch,  the TEAM CELEBRATED after work.. Why did the team celebrate? (the team was exhilarated by the successful launch)  

**状语的位置**  
关于状语在句子中的位置。状语并不像名词修饰语一样在句子中有顺序限制，因为一个句子通常只有一个或两个主句，所以状语的位置的变化不会产生语意的歧义。只要能够清楚地知道状语修饰的是哪个动词或句子，这个句子就是能接受的。如The engineer rapidly IDENTIFIED the problem和The engineer IDENTIFIED the problem rapidly都是可以的。  

然而，有些情况下，状语的位置也会有错误的情况。如，He walked and caught up with his sister more rapidly. rapidly修饰的是catch up with，语意也就是他更快地追上了他的妹妹，然而这是不合逻辑了，而实际想表达的意思是“他走得更快了，从而追上了他妹妹”，所以应该改为He walked more rapidly and caught up with his sister.  

The CEO declared that everyone had to work every day through the holidays to make the production deadline, but in calling for such an extreme measure, the company's employees were upset to the point of mutiny.

对于，上面的句子The phrase in calling for such an extreme measure is a “comma–ing”， Such modifiers refer to the entire clause to which they are attached.这样的修饰语修饰与它相连的整个句子，就是the company's employees were upset to the point of mutiny，然而这个extreme measure是CEO提出的，而不是the company's employees，所以用calling是不对的。  
这个句子有两个改法：  
In an extreme measure, the CEO declared that everyone had to work every day through the holidays to make the production deadline; her employees were upset to the point of mutiny.  
或者 The CEO declared that everyone had to work every day through the holidays to make the production deadline, but in calling for such an extreme measure, she upset her employees to the point of mutiny.  

**8. 分词的位置以及主从句间的关系代词**  

**分词修饰语的顺序**  
分词修饰语的作用：在用分词修饰语时，句子前面提供的信息，导致了句子后面提供的信息。  
如Exhilarated by the successful product launch, the TEAM CELEBRATED after work表示Because the team was exhilarated, it celebrated或者The exhilaration led to the celebration.  
在有分词做状语的句子中，Whichever statement comes first in the sentence, whether modifier or main clause, is the instigating（教唆）action, and whichever comes second, is the effect or result.也就是说，只要句子里有分词的状语，无论分词在前还是在后，前部分的句子是原因或促成因素，后部分的句子是结果。  
想象下这样一个场景：a woman ice skating, she loses her balance, crashes to the ice, and then clutches her ankle in pain.下面哪个句子能够形容这个画面？  
Slipping on the ice, she broke her ankle. 是slipping on the ice导致的she broke her ankle，所以对的。Breaking her ankle, she slipped on the ice.不是Breaking her ankle导致的she slipped on the ice，所以错误。She slipped on the ice, breaking her ankle. She slipped on the ice导致了breaking her ankle，所以正确。

**Subordinators： 主从句间的连词**  
看下面一个句子：Although the economy is strong, the RETAIL INDUSTRY IS STRUGGLING.这句子的前半部分是从句，尽管它很像一个完整的句子，但是它由连词although引导，从句不是一个完整的句子。  
Subordinate clauses modify the main clause to which they are attached. 从句修饰与他们紧连的主句。如例子所示despite the fact that the overall economy is doing well, one particular industry is not.  
常见的主从句间的连词主要有：although, if, before, yet, unless, after, because, while, that, since, so that, when.  
注意，选词，当句子想要表达比较时，句子一定是比较的意思，如Although the economy is strong, the retail industry is doing well, 前面的从句和后面的主句是相似的意思，没有形成对比，所以用although不对。  
主从句连词与常见的FANBOYS连词相似，在两种情况下，都必须保证所选的词语正确地符合逻辑地连接两个部分，需要注意的是，两类连词是不可以互换的。

首先：Use only one connecting word per “connection”（每个连接处只用一个连词），如Wrong: ALTHOUGH I need to relax, YET I have so many things to do!  Right: ALTHOUGH I need to relax, I have so many things to do!  Right: I need to relax, YET I have so many things to do!  

其次，Make sure that clauses are connected by a sensible connecting word（选对正确的连接词），如Wrong: She is not interested in playing sports, AND she likes watching them on TV. Right: She is not interested in playing sports, BUT she likes watching them on TV. Right: ALTHOUGH she is not interested in playing sports, she likes watching them on TV.  

最后，be on the lookout for sentences that join a main clause to something that should be a clause but is not actually a clause，注意将主句连接到应该是句子而又不是的sentences，如  
Wrong: Citizens of many countries are expressing concern about the environmental damage caused by the widespread release of greenhouse gases may be impossible to reverse.  

分析：citizens是主语，are expressing是动词，然而又出来了may be动词，一个句子不可能有两个动词，看下什么是不可恢复的？environmental damage，那么environmental damage是may be的主语，所以environmental……应该是一个新的从句。  
改为：Citizens of many countries are expressing concern THAT the environmental damage caused by the widespread release of greenhouse gases may be impossible to reverse. 这个新的句子里，主语的主要结构是citizens are expressing，从句的主要结构是environmental damage…may be…  
还有一种改法，大家看下Citizens of many countries are expressing concern about the environmental damage caused by the widespread release of greenhouse gases, DAMAGE THAT may be impossible to reverse. 在这个句子中，主语在greenhouse gases处结束，damage that…为主句提供additional information。  

**9. which VS.现在分词；核心与修饰**  
**which和现在分词Which vs. the Present Participle -ing**  
有很多现实生活常用语并不符合GMAT语法，如下句所示
Crime has recently decreased in our neighborhood, WHICH has led to a rise in property values. 在本句中，导致a rise in property values的是Crime has recently decreased in our neighborhood，而which在任何时候必须指一个名词，而不能指一句话。可以用以下改法  
The recent decrease in crime in our neighborhood has led to a rise in property values.  
或 Crime has recently decreased in our neighborhood, leading to a rise in property values.  

Again, in speech, people often break these rules, incorrectly using which to refer to a previous thought that is not a noun. In fact, the GMAT has made the same mistake in Sentence Correction explanations and even in a Reading Comprehension passage! 用which指代前面整个句子的情况在日常生活中很常见，甚至GMAT的OG在阅读原文中或语法题目解释中都会犯这个错误。Always test which clauses to make sure that the which refers to the closest preceding main noun and not the whole clause.而在考试中，要记住which指代离它最近的名词（这个在OG里貌似有例外）。  

**修饰语和句子核心Modifier vs. Core**  
看下面的例子：  
George Carlin, both shocking and entertaining audiences across the nation, who also struggled publicly with drug abuse, influenced and inspired a generation of comedians. 划线部分是两个很长的修饰George Carlin的修饰语，然而它们导致了awkward or incorrect phrasings，而且who与它所要修饰的George Carlin太远。  
改成下面这样就会好些：Both shocking and entertaining audiences across the nation, George Carlin, who also struggled publicly with drug abuse, influenced and inspired a generation of comedians.  

On harder questions, GMAT answers are more likely to rephrase the sentence so that one of the modifiers becomes part of the core of the sentence; that is, it is no longer a modifier. GMAT考试为了增加考试难度，在改写句子时，会将部分修饰部分改成句子的核心部分，如上面的句子，这样写最好: Both shocking and entertaining audiences across the nation, George Carlin influenced and inspired a generation of comedians yet struggled publicly with drug abuse. 这句话的核心部分是Carlin influenced and inspired yet struggled. 两个连词（and, yet）连接了三个动词（influenced, inspired, struggled）  

有时修饰部分和核心部分的前后顺序可以改变，如  
Employing the new lab equipment, the engineer identified the problem quickly.（修饰——核心）  
The engineer employed the new lab equipment, identifying the problem within minutes.（核心——修饰）  

再看下面的例子  
Pushed to justify his decision, the manager froze and was unable to say anything, eventually breaking down in tears.（修饰——核心——修饰）  
或The manager froze and was unable to say anything when he was pushed to justify his decision; he eventually broke down in tears.（核心——修饰——核心）   
只要句子表达的语意是符合逻辑并且清晰的，核心与修饰部分的位置可以改变。  

**10. Quantity（词语表达的量）**  

**Rule #1: Words Used for Countable Things vs. Words Used for Uncountable Things（可数名词和不可数名词）**  
在英语表达中有可数名词，如hat(s),feeling(s), and person/people；还有不可数名词，如patience, water, and furniture.可数名词和不可数名词在修饰词上有所不同  
而More, most, enough, 和 all既能修饰可数名词复数也能修饰不可数名词，如more hats; more patience; most people; most furniture; enough hats; enough patience; all people; all furniture.

不能用less修饰可数名词，这是在日常用语中常犯的错误，我们不能说10 items or less，因为items不可数，应该说10 items or fewer。再看下面两个句子：
Wrong: There were less Numidian KINGS than Roman emperors. Right: There were fewer Numidian KINGS than Roman emperors.

此外，要小心单位名词（unit nouns），比如dollars or gallons，从常理分析来看，这些单位名词是可数的，因为我们可以说one dollar, two dollars, three dollars；然而，这些单位名词代表的是不可数名词money和volume，我们不能说one money (volume), two moneys(volumes)，所以正确的为We have less than 20 DOLLARS.如果是用fewer的话，应该把句子改成，We have fewer than 20DOLLAR BILLS.  

**Rule #2: Words Used to Relate Two Things vs. Words Used to Relate Three or More Things（比较级和最高级）**  
比较级：better, worse, more, less 比较两个事物       例句：The rabbit is faster than the toad.  
最高级：best, worst, most, least比较三个或多个事物  例句：The rabbit is the fastest of all of the animals at the farm.  
此外，当讨论两个人或事时，用between，当讨论三个或以上时用among。  

**Rule #3: The Word Numbers 讨论数字时当比较数字大小时，要用greater than而不是more than**  
如：The rare Montauk beaked griffin is not extinct; its NUMBERS are now suspected to be much GREATER than before.  

**Rule #4: Increase and Decrease vs. Greater and Less**  
increase和decrease是同一事物，不同时间的不同情况的比较；greater和less是不同事物，在同一时间不同情况的比较。  
例句：The price of silver INCREASED by 10 dollars.  
The price of silver is five dollars GREATER than the price of copper.  

同时，要注意increase和decrease有时会产生redundancy（重复）。如decrease和fall、drop，increase和grow。例句：Wrong: The price of silver FELL by a more than 35% DECREASE.           Right: The price of silver DECREASED by more than 35%.      Right: The price of silver FELL by more than 35%.  

## Chapter 5  Parallelism
#### 平行标志与平行要素   
**1.什么是平行？**  
平行就是比较的部分，在结构上和逻辑上都是相似的。  
看下面的例子：The employees were upset by the company's low pay, poor working conditions, and that they did not have enough outlets for their creativity.  
这个句子有three comparable parts：the company's low pay；the company's poor working conditions；that they did not have enough outlets for their creativity。前两个部分都是名词形式，结构和逻辑上都相似，但第三部分是从句形式，需要改成三个都是名词形式或三个都是从句形式。  
改为：The employees were upset by the company's low pay, poor working conditions, and shortage of outlets for employees’ creativity.  

三个comparable部分的前面，也就是“The employees were upset by”是root phrase，每个部分都必须从root phrase开始，所以当你不确定时可以将每个部分单独与root phrase连接试下。  

**2. Parallelism Markers 平衡的标志词**  
知道了什么是平行，那么应该什么时候用平行呢？这里有一些标志词：open的标志词—放在比较部分的中间；close的标志词：比较部分前面和后面都有该标志词。
 
**3. 平行要素Parallel Elements**  
The main word or clause in each element is required to be parallel, and each element has to connect to the root phrase of the sentence.要素中的主要词语或句子要平行，并且每个要素必须与root phrase相连。
 
句子中的open markers会增加寻找平行要素开始点的困难。  
如：Wrong: I want to retire to a place WHERE I can relax AND I pay low taxes.  
这个句子，看一眼，貌似是对的，但是and前后都是独立的句子，所以平行要素就有了歧义：I want to retire to a place WHERE I can relax和I pay low taxes平行，而实际语意应该是I can relax和I pay low taxes平行，所以正确的形式应为Right: I want to retire to a place WHERE I can relax AND WHERE I pay low taxes.  

同时，平行结构的signal words不一定要相同，如Right: There are many people WHO speak English BUT WHOSE parents do not.

当用closed markers时，第一个标志词后面的就是第一个平行要素，并且此要素要与后面的在结构上和逻辑上相似。如Wrong: Ralph likes BOTH those who are popular AND who are not as well-liked.第一个要素里有those，而第二个里没有，不平行，所以应该改为Right: Ralph likes BOTH those who are popular AND those who are not as well-liked.
 
上面的三个句子中：was、can、wanted to后面可以接共同的平行要素，也就是说If an open marker is used, the sentence can split apart those expressions, so that the first word or words count across all of the elements.

小结：当句子中出现open markers时，检查open marker前后的平行要素是不是有歧义，有歧义的话就是错误选项；当句子中出现closed markers时，检查平行要素里是否都包含必要的starting words，只有都包括时才是对的。

#### 实际平行与and
**1. Superficial Parallelism vs. Actual Parallelism表面平行与实际平行**  
注意：在使用平行结构时，不要使用过度。看下面的例子：Sal applied himself in his new job, arriving early every day, skipping lunch regularly, AND leaving late every night.有些同学为了追求平行，会把arriving，skipping和leaving改成与applied一致的过去时，然而这样做是不符合语意的。

上面的句子中，arriving early every day, skipping lunch regularly, 和leaving late every night是平行的关系，它们三个共同修饰how Sal applied himself in his new job。如果，把后面的三个平行部分改成过去时的话，虽然语法正确，但语意发生了改变，Sal applied himself in his new job, arrived early every day, skipped lunch regularly, AND left late every night. 四个动作完全的平等的，没有任何联系，它也有可能表达这种意思Sal applied himself in his new job, arrived early every day at the gym, skipped lunch regularly on the weekend, AND left the bar late every Saturday night.

**2. and 连接两个平行要素**
and是最基本的平行标志词，它连接的平行要素可以是主语、谓语、可以是从句、也可以是修饰部分。具体看以下例句。  
>主语平行：The manager AND her team were praised by the CEO.  
>谓语平行：In one terrible day, the account manager lost a client AND greeted the CEO of her company by the wrong name.  
>从句平行：New data indicate that, over the course of the past week, the stock market jumped AND the unemployment rate decreased.  
>介词短语平行：A rapid improvement in motor function AND vision was observed.  
>状语平行：Historians have uncovered new evidence, confirming several theories AND giving rise to new hypotheses.  

当平行部分做修饰语时，如上述例句中的介词短语以及状语，平行部分单独与root phrase连用时，在结构上和逻辑上必须都合理。如，将上面的介词短语平行部分进行拆分，两个单独的句子在结构上和逻辑上都合理：  
A rapid improvement in motor function was observed.  
A rapid improvement in vision was observed.

再如，我们上状语平行的例子改为 “Historians have uncovered new evidence, confirming several theories AND gave rise to new hypotheses” 进行拆分的话，会得到：Historians have uncovered new evidence, confirming several theories. Historians have uncovered new evidence, gave rise to new hypotheses.（这部分在语法上和语意上都不对）

在利用此规律时，有 2 点值得注意:  
第一：working verb平行时，时态不一定一致She eats apples all the time AND drank some apple juice yesterday.  
第二：分词并列时，可以是过去分词与现在分词平行，尽管这在GMAT考试中并不常见The cat slept in the sun, fatigued by play and dreaming of the mouse that got away.

And 连接3- or 4-Item Lists  
and还可以连接3个或4个items，而这些items也要平行，如  
X, Y, and Z——apples, pears, AND bananas  
X, Y, Z, and W——apples, pears, bananas, AND peaches  
需要注意的是，在列举时，最后一个item前面必须要有and。此外，在GMAT语法中，当and连接的元素在3个或以上时，在最后一个item前要加“，+and”，如下面的例句所示  
>Right: In today's news, technology stocks are up, while the pharmaceutical, energy, AND retail sectors are down.
>Wrong: She argues that the agency acts with disregard for human life AND property AND reckless abandon.

The agency acts with disregard for human life and the agency acts with disregard for property. It does not, however, act with disregard for reckless abandon; this is illogical.也就是这个机构忽略了人权、所有权，同时这个机构也轻易放弃，可以改成下面的形式：  
She argues THAT the agency acts WITH reckless abandon AND WITH disregard for human life AND property.
 
#### 平行结构中的固定短语与系动词
**1. Idioms with Built-in Parallel Structure平行结构中的固定短语**  
在平行结构中不仅要求要素X与Y平行，也就是结构与逻辑上相似，而且要求固定短语以正确的形式出现，如both X and Y, both和and必须同时出现。  
下面有一些常见的平行中用到的短语  
`Between X and Y`      `Distinguish X from Y`      `Think of X as Y`     `View X as Y`   
`Consider X Y`（这个短语经常会写成错误的Consider X as Y，考试如遇到，直接排除带as的）
`Estimate X to be Y`     `In contrast to X, Y`        `Mistake X for Y`      `Whether X or Y`

**2. linking verbs act as parallelism markers系动词做平行标志词**  
A certain class of verb, the linking verb, is used to describe what a subject is or what condition the subject is in. These linking verbs are parallelism markers.系动词用来描述主语是什么或主语处于什么情境，这些系动词也是平行的标志词。

首先：系动词连接的主语和宾语单复数要一致如：The bouquet of flowers WAS a gift of love. the bouquet of flowers是主语，was是系动词（本句的谓语），a gift of love是宾语。这时候说the bouquet of flowers是什么，既然主语是单数形式，那么它是的东西也必须是单数，也就是a gift。

其次，系动词连接的主语和宾语的词性要平行此外，此前学习的and连接平行要素的规律为名词与名词，动词与动词……  
判断这个例句是否正确？The bouquet of flowers WAS a giving of love. 主语the bouquet of flowers而它对应的宾语却是动名词，所以错误。Gerunds can be parallel to other gerunds or to action nouns, but they cannot be parallel to plain nouns, such as bouquet.动名词可以与动名词或动作名词相平行，但不能与名词平行。

最后，系动词连接的主语和宾语要符合逻辑如，Wrong: Upon being nominated, this politician IS a step forward in urban-rural relations in this country. 政治家本身是一个进步？不符合逻辑，应该是政治家的提名是一个进步。所以改为：The nomination of this politician IS a step forward in urban–rural relations in this country.
 

## Chapter 6  Comparisons
#### 比较与比较词  
**1. 什么是比较？**  
比较是平行的一种，但为什么要单独拿出一章来讲呢？因为它有一些自己的规则，而且它也非常重要。  
先看下面一个例子：Like Mary, Adam's car is green.  这不合逻辑。  
那么我们可以改成以下这种形式：LIKE Mary's car, Adam's car is green.  

再看下面这个正确的句子：UNLIKE the architect's design for the new park, the mayor's plan kept most of the existing trees.两个比较对象是architect的design和mayor的plan。

小结：首先，比较的对象必须符合平行的要求，例如名词对名词；其次，除了平行以外，比较的对象还要求是同一类事物，如people to people, plans to plans, car to car, and so on.

**2. 比较的标志词**  
比较时，比较的内容一定要符合逻辑。在比较时，有多种写法，使得比较对象符合逻辑。  
以“X, like Y，怎么怎么样”为例  

首先：最常见的比较方法 Frank, LIKE his brother, has a broad and muscular build.  

其次：用that代表比较的东西 Frank's build, LIKE that of his brother, is broad and muscular. （that指代build）

最后：有些比较会直接省略掉第二个比较要素 Frank's build, LIKE his brother's, is broad and muscular. （比较的是Frank的身材和他哥哥的身材，第二个比较要素中省略build）

学习之后，我们看以下例子  
>Beethoven's music, which broke a number of established rules with its structure and melodic form, is considered more revolutionary than Bach.  

摘出比较词、比较要素与句子主干：  
Beethoven's music is considered MORE revolutionary THAN Bach. 比较词是more than，比较要素是Beethoven的music和Bach，音乐和人比？错了，要音乐to音乐，或人to人。  
所以，改成：Beethoven's music, which broke a number of established rules with its structure and melodic form, is considered MORE revolutionary THAN Bach’s. （属于第三种情况，省略第二个比较要素）

要记住，GMAT考试中比较是actually contrasts，也就是说比较的两个要素是不同的，而不是相同的。
 
#### 比较中的省略、as与like的用法、比较级与最高级
**1. Omitted Words**  
下面的例子在比较时将比较的第二个因素省略  
Right: My car is bigger than Brian's [car]. （省略了car）  
上面的句子结尾是apostrophe-s（撇s）代表Brian是一个人，而下面的s-apostrophe（s撇）则只不止一个人。  
Right: My house is smaller than the Smiths’ [house]. 这里可能是说Smith一家的房子  

在省略时，只要不给比较造成歧义 ，你可以把第二个比较要素里的units（单位）, verbs（动词）, and even whole clauses（整个从句）。看下面的几个例子：  
>Right: Whereas I drink two quarts of milk a day, my friend drinks three [quarts of milk a day]. 省略单位  
>Right: I walk faster than Brian [walks]. 省略动词  
>Right: I walk as fast now as [I walked] when I was younger. 省略从句  

再看下面这个例句 I like cheese more than Yvette. 这个句子就歧义了，Yvette是个人名还是食物名？是I like cheese more than [I like] Yvette?还是I like cheese more than Yvette [like cheese]?所以这个句子这样省略是不对的。  
为了使语意明确，可以有以下两种改法  
Right: I like cheese more than Yvette DOES. (more than Yvette likes cheese)  
Right: I like cheese more than I DO Yvette. (more than I like Yvette)

同时，在GMAT考试中，有时会出现一些无意义的助动词，如下面的例子：  
Right: Apples are healthier to eat than caramels（太妃糖）.  
Right: Apples are healthier to eat than caramels ARE.  
The second sentence is not considered redundant or incorrect. If you see this on the test, ignore it and find some other difference on which to base your decision.  

**2. Like vs. As**  
Like和as是常见的比较词，like可以引导名词、代词和名词短语的比较，但不能引导句子的比较，但as可以，以下面的三个句子为例：  
LIKE her brother, Ava aced the test. Like引导名词短语，人与人比，正确。  
LIKE her brother DID, Ava aced the test. Like不能引导句子，所以错误。  
As her brother DID, Ava aced the test. As可以引导句子，所以正确。  

According to the GMAT, there is no difference in meaning between Like her brother, Ava aced the test and As her brother did, Ava aced the test. You can compare Ava and her brother directly, or you can compare what they did, as long as you follow the appropriate grammar rules when writing the sentence.

**3. Comparative and Superlative Forms比较级和最高级**  
比较两个事物用形容词或副词的比较级，比较三个或以上的事物用形容词或副词的最高级，如下面的例子：  
Comparative: She is SHORTER than her sister.  
Superlative: She is the SHORTEST of her five siblings.  
Comparative: You are MORE INTERESTING than he.  
Superlative: You are the MOST INTERESTING person here.  

在用比较级时，要注意3点：  
首先，在比较以-ly结尾的词时，不要在后面加er，要在前面加一个单词more  
Wrong: Adrian runs QUICKLY.     比较级He runs QUICKER than Jacob.  
Right: Adrian runs QUICKLY.      比较级He runs MORE QUICKLY than Jacob  

其次，在比较时，单词如果不以-ly结尾，加er变成比较级（当然有些以y结尾的，要变y为i+er）  
Right: Adrian runs FAST.         比较级He runs FASTER than Jacob.  

最后，只有出现了THAN才采用比较级  
Wrong: With winter coming, I will have HIGHER energy bills.  
尽管在上面的句子中，暗示了，冬天的energy bills会比以前更高些，但在GMAT考试中，必须做出明确的比较，也就是说必须有THAN和明确的比较对象。上面的句子可以改为  
I will have HIGHER bills THAN last year. （此比较省略了句子，than I had last year）

## Chapter 7  Pronouns
#### 代词与先行词必须一致  
**1. 什么是代词？**  
A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun, so that you do not have to repeat that noun elsewhere in the sentence.代词就是替代句子中之前出现过的名词的此外，从此不必在之后的句子里重复使用该名词，看下面的例子  
GASOLINE has become so expensive that it now consumes as much as 16% of personal income in some rural areas. 代词it指代名词gasoline，这个gasoline就是it的antecedent（先行词）了。

在GMAT语法考试中，如果划线部分出现代词，要注意以下几点：选项里是否也出现了代词？代词有没有区分单复数？是在代词和一个常规名词之间吗？  
GMAT考试中，如果你认为未划线部分的代词有问题，找到它的先行词，如果先行词也没划线，那么不要纠结它了，它是对的；如果它的先行词是划线的，在选项里找找，是否有更合适的先行词。  

**2. The Antecedent Must Exist and Be Sensible先行词与代词必须一致并且合理**  
当代词出现时，前面必须有先行词（必须是名词），且先行词必须是合理的，看下面的例子The park rangers discussed measures to prevent severe wildfires, which would be devastating to it. 在该句子，it的先行词是什么？要表达的是“大火会毁灭公园”，所以it指代的是park，然而在此句中，park是rangers的修饰词，所以it没有先行词。  
小心形容词，它们不能是先行词，先行词一定是名词！

此外，不要忽略“语意”，看下面的例子：  
Although the term “supercomputer” may sound fanciful or exaggerated, it is simply an extremely fast mainframe that can execute trillions of calculations every second.  
Mainframe主机，fanciful奇怪的。也许，很多同学认为the term “supercomputer”是it要指代的名词了，那么我们来把it替换掉：the term “supercomputer” is simply an extremely fast mainframe that can execute trillions of calculations every second. The term is not a mainframe; rather, the term refers to a mainframe.语意不合逻辑，所以错误。在本句中，it指代mainframe。

所以，我们可以把句子改成下面这种更明白地表达方式：Although the TERM “supercomputer” may sound fanciful or exaggerated, it simply REFERS TO an extremely fast mainframe that can execute trillions of calculations every second. 现在it指代the term就符合语意了。  
在考试中，如何判断先行词是否正确呢？将句子中的代词，用先行词替换，然后看下新的句子是否make sense，如果语意上是正确的话，先行词就对的。  

#### 常见代词  
**1. The Antecedent and Pronoun Must Agree in Number先行词与代词的单复一致**  
如果选项中的先行词，有单数和复数都出现了，那么要回到原句子来判断，可以借助先行词的代词或动词来确定先行词的单复形式。看下面的例子：  
>Confronted by radical changes in production and distribution, modern Hollywood studios are attempting various experiments in an effort to retain its status as the primary arbiter of movie consumption.  

Its指代studios，然而it是单数形似，而studio是复数形式，所以要改变先行词或代词的单复数。  
>将代词改为复数形式：Confronted by radical changes in production and distribution, modern Hollywood STUDIOS are attempting various experiments in an effort to retain their status as the primary arbiters of movie consumption.  
>将先行词改为单数形式：Confronted by radical changes in production and distribution, the modern Hollywood STUDIO is attempting various experiments in an effort to retain its status as the primary arbiter of movie consumption.  
在GMAT考试中，在先行词和代词之间会出现一些插入语来增加难度，做题时需要注意。

**2. The Deadly Five: It, Its, They, Them, Their常见的5个代词**  
常见的单数单词为it，its；常见的复数代词为they，them和their。无论何时在划线部分看到这些代词，都要看选项里出现的是否与划线一致，如果不一致，则需要找到先行词，然后确定究竟用哪个代词。  
此外，要注意their，在口语中经常用的their用法，在GMAT考试中是不正确的，看下面3个例句（GMAT语法中，严格要求先行词与代词的单复数一致）  
>Wrong: Whenever a STUDENT calls, take down their information.          单数对复数  
>Right: Whenever a STUDENT calls, take down his or her information.       单数对单数  
>Right: Whenever STUDENTS call, take down their information.            复数对复数  

**3. This, That, These, and Those**  
第一：this, that, these, and those 可以用作名词前的形容词，  
如：New“NANO-PAPERS” incorporate fibers that give these materials strength. NANO-PAPERS纳米纸  

第二，that和those indicate a “new copy” or copies of the antecedent，通常用在比较中，如：The MONEY spent by her parents is less than that spent by her children.在上面的句子中，that spent by her children是指money spent by her children，与the money by her parents不是相同的money。然而在用“it，its，them， they， their”这5个代词时，代词与先行词必须是同一个，而不是创造出“new copy”。  
看下面的例子：The MONEY SPENT BY HER PARENTS is more than it was expected to be. It与前面的money都是指spent by her parents的。

第三，that和those在指代new copy或new copies时，new copy/copies必须要被修饰，也就是需要有修饰语来区分new copy与previous version的区别。  
如：The MONEY spent by her parents is less than that spent by her children. 划线部分修饰that，如果去掉变成The MONEY spent by her parents is less than that，那么that 是什么，语意不明，所以错误。  
同理：Her COMPANY is outperforming that of her competitor. 划线部分修饰that  

第四，that与those指代new copy/copies时，单复数形式一定与previous version一致。  
如Wrong: Her COMPANY is outperforming those of her competitors. Company是单数，those是复数，所以错误。但是competitors是复数，必须用复数，这种情况下，要怎么办呢？不用代词，直接重复上面的名词，如下所示：Right: Her COMPANY is outperforming the companies of her competitors.  

第五，不能用this和these替换名词This is great.在日常生活中很常见，但在GMAT考试，此句子就造成了不能接受的模糊。此外，一定要记住第三点里说的，that和those只有在被修饰的情况下才能替代名词。看下面的例句：  
>Wrong: Her PRODUCTS are unusual; many consider these unique.  
>Right: Her PRODUCTS are unusual; many consider them unique.  

#### 代词里有些模糊还是可以接受的
**1. Some Ambiguity Is Acceptable有些特定的模糊是可以接受的**  
首先，在规范的英语写作中，一个句子中的每个代词应该只有一个先行词。也就是说，假如句子中有两个it，其中一个代表A，另外一个代表B，这种用法是错误。

其次，GMAT语法倾向于用same class的代词代表同一个名词。It与its是同一class，they，them和their是同一class。但是，这只是优先考虑的答案，并不是排除答案的规律。GMAT中有一些句子，用同一class里的代词指代不同的名词，如:  
>Researchers claim to have developed new “nano-papers” incorporating tiny cellulose fibers, which THEY allege give THEM the strength of cast iron. 

They, 是谁声称？当然是研究者，所以they指代researchers；而them是指研究者吗？让谁更强韧呢？当然是纳米纸了，所以them指代nano-papers。这在GMAT考试中是可以接受的，如果选项中没有更加清晰且语法正确的句子，那么上面的句子就是最优选项。  
为减少模糊，可以改成下面的写法  
>Right: Researchers claim to have developed new“nano-papers” incorporating tiny cellulose fibers, which give THESE MATERIALS the strength of cast iron, according to the researchers.

再次，If you spot a split between a pronoun and a regular noun, chances are good that the correct answer will use the regular noun, since that usage will prevent any possible misreading of a pronoun.就像上面的例子，名词nano-paper与代词them不相邻，这样容易造成模糊，所以用regular noun “these materials”而不是代词。  

最后，选项中只含一个代词，却有很多可能的先行词，怎么判断？GMAT有时认为这是错的，有时可以接受这种模糊，那到底要怎么判断呢？以后的chapter 12里会讲到。
